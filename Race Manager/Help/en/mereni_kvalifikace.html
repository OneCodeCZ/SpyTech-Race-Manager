<h2>Qualification measurement</h2>

<table align=right><tr>
  <td width=16></td>
  <td><img src="img/qual.png"></td>
</tr></table>

<p>
  If the qualification is enabled in the race system used, the race begins with
  the qualification part. The current status is indicated in the tree view in the
  name of the main race folder. Now, the folder item name reads <i>Race -- Qualification</i>.
  Run the measurement by issuing <i>Begin race part measurement</i> command.
  You will be prompted to confirm the command.
<p>
  The picture on the right edge of this page shows the flow chart of the
  qualification measurement process. Each box represents a status of the system
  (e.g. pause, segment run, or an information screen kept on the screen)
  and each arrow represents an even to be recognized or an action that is to be
  taken in order to get into the next status.
<p>
  The meaning of the icons within the picture is as follows:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td width=64><img src="img/icon_red.png"></td><td>The track is unpowered in the status</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="img/icon_green.png"></td><td>The track powered in the status</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="img/icon_p.png"></td><td>SPACE key pressed in such status holds the countdown until pressed again</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="img/icon_semaphore.png"></td><td>A starting semaphore is shown during the transition to the next status</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="img/icon_a.png"></td><td>A letter key pressed in such status advances the countdown several seconds before the end (all racers are already prepared and there is no need to keep the whole pause)</td></tr>
  <tr><td><img src="img/icon_b.png"> <img src="img/icon_c.png"></td><td>B and C letter keys have special meaning in the status. They will be discussed in the later text.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  Now for the description of the qualification measurement. After the measurement
  is started, a race title screen is shown.
</p>
<img src="img/screen_qual_begins.gif">
<p>
  Press ENTER in order to advance to the next screen, the current results (presented as
  a list of all racers) is shown.
</p>
<img src="img/screen_qual_current_results.gif">
<p>
  Press ENTER to advance to the countdown before the first qualification attempt. The
  time countdown field shows the number of seconds before the attempt starts. The progress
  bar at the bottom edge of the screen fills with light grey color, as the time elapses.
  The box in the right bottom edge is the indicator of the power supply to the track.
  Red means the track is unpowered, green means the track is supplied with the electric
  power. There is a field <i>Next racers</i> containing the next 10 (or less) racers that
  are in order to take their qualification attempts. When the countdown elapses, the
  screen is switched to the main qualification status window.
</p>

<p>
  The meaning of the data field names are self-explanatory. 
  If the racer decides to quit the current qualification attempt and to keep
  his time for the next one, press the <i>B</i> letter key. According to the rules, from his
  time left, 30 secons are subtracted and the rest can be used by the racer in the
  next round of qualification attempts, if specified so in the race system. If the
  racer decides to quit the qualification once and for all, press the <i>C</i> letter key.
  The racer will not be asked to take his qualification attempt in the next round.
</p>
<p>
  After the qualification attempt is terminated, the screen with the current results
  is shown again and another pause countdown runs.
  After all rounds and attempts are done, the qualification closing result screen
  is shown.
</p>

<p>
  Press ENTER to quit the measurement environment if the audience in your track hall
  is done with reading.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Important:</b> After you quit the measurement, you are supposed to perform the
  transition to the next race part (which is, according to your race system settings,
  either heats, quarter final, semifinal or final). The transition is done with
  the <i>End the current part</i> command in the <i>Race</i> menu.
  After that, the <i>Qualification results</i> sheet is created and ready to
  be shown and printed out.
</p>
<p>
  You are now ready to perform the measurement of the next race part.
