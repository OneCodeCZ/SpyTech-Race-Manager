<h2>
  Measurement of other race parts</h2>
<p>
  You may refedine the group distribution before you begin to measure
  the segments of the race part. See the chapter
  <a href="skupiny.html">Groups</a> for how to do so.
<p>
  After your groups are defined in the way you require, select the command
  <i>Start measurement</i> in the <i>Race</i> menu. The measurement is performed group by group. After
  the first group of the race part is done with measurement, the program returns
  to the main application window. The measurement of the next group is started
  by issuing the same command again. A special result sheet is created for
  each group measrured. The measurement of each group goes like this:
  (See <a href="mereni_kvalifikace.html">Qualification measurement</a> chapter
  for meaning of symbols.)

  First, the title screen of the next race part is shown. Press the ENTER key
  to continue. Then, the initial lane assignment dialog window is shown. In this
  moment you may specify which lane each racer should be assigned to in their
  first segment of this race part. Press <i>OK</i> button to confirm your settings.
<p>
  Then, then main race display screen is shown.

<p>
  The name of the part, letter of the group and the current segment number
  is shown in the title area of the screen. Under that, the list of racers
  if the group is shown. Each line represents one racer. The following data
  are shown:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lane – The lane number and color</li>
  <li>Racer – Display name of the racer</li>
  <li>Last lap – The time of the last lap</li>
  <li>Best lap – The best lap time of the racer in the current segment</li>
  <li>Laps – Number of laps elapsed by the racer in the current segment</li>
  <li>Total – Total number of laps elapsed in the whole race part</li>
  <li>Gap – The difference of number of laps of the racer and the best racer in the race part</li>
  <li>Prognosis – Estimated total number of laps in the race part</li>
  <li>Position – Estimated position of the racer according to the prognosis</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Press the ENTER to initiate the warm-up. The warm-up takes the time specified
  in the race part or it might be shortened up by pressing the <i>A</i> letter key
  if its full duration is not required by the racers.
<p>
  After the warm-up ends, you may press the ENTER key again to begin the
  five second timer (ended by start lights and beep) and then the measurement
  of the first segment begins.
<p>
  The SPACE bar allows you to pause the segment.
  The power supply is shut down but the stopwatch runs for 1.5 second more so
  that the sensors passed through by cars driven by motion inertia might
  get properly counted. Press SPACE bar again to resume the segment. Short
  start signals and beeps are produced. The segment takes the time specified
  in the race system.
<p>
  If there is more racers than lanes, the warm-up is started again so that
  9th racer who was on pause in the previous segment may warm-up their car.
  After the warm-up, another five second countdown is kept and the the second
  segment takes place. Another warm-up is started after the second segment,
  if there is 10 races in group in total.
<p>
  If there is no warm-up needed, the pause follows each segment. It also takes
  the time defined by the race system.
<p>
  The last segment is followed by a dialog window that prompts you to
  specify at how many track segments each car stopped at. Press the <i>Confirm</i>
  button to conform the settings. In this place, you may specify also the
  penalty points for each racer.
<p>
  Then, the group results are shown and the program waits for the ENTER
  key to be pressed in order to return to the main application window.

<p>
  After the last group has been measured and the main window appears back,
  you are asked whether the data were measured correctly. If they were,
  you may answer Yes. If there were some problems during the measurement
  and the group results or whole race part results should be discarded,
  answer No. You may then either perform the <a href="navrat.html">race reset</a>
  and measure certain part of the race again, or you may enter the result
  editor, whose usage is self explanatory. Command <i>Results editor</i>
  in menu <i>Race</i>.
