<h2>Race definition</h2>
<p>
  A new race is created using <i>File | New | Race</i> command (or ctrl+N shortcut
  or appropriate icon in the toolbar). First, you get prompted to choose a race system
  to be used. In the popup window, you may choose any race system you have previously
  defined. Then press OK button.
<p>
  Then, the property sheet window <i>Race properties</i> pops up.

</p>
  Fill in the
  organization data (to be displayed on the result sheets), specify, whether
  this is a race of individuals or teams, and the <i>minimal lap time</i>. This value
  is the time for which any sensor is inactive after a car passed through, in order to
  partially avoid the problem of false lane counts when multiple cars are on a
  single lane (e.g. after an accident). The selection of the minimal lap time is
  to be carefully considered. We recommend approx. 80% of the lap record on your track.
  For the G27 category of the EC 2000 in Zlín we chose 1750 ms while the fastest laps
  were as much as 1950 ms.
<p>
  After the OK button is pushed, the race definition itself is begun. In the
  tree view window at the left margin of the application window a new tree
  view named <i>Race</i> appears. Now with these item: <i>Race -- definition</i>
  with the folder of <i>Documents</i> and the race system you have selected.
  The <i>Documents</i> folder is now empty. It will contain all the documents
  automatically generated during the race.
<p>
  Now it is necessary to define, which racers are about to attend the race.
  Switch back to the <i>Database</i> tree by clicking on its tab in the bottom
  left corner of the application window. Double-click on the <i>Racers</i> folder.
  Their list appears on the right side of the application window. (The program 
  behaves in the similar manner as the Windows Explorer.)
  Then go back to the <i>Race</i> tree.
<p>
  Use your mouse to drag-and-drop the selected racers onto the
  <i>Race -- definition</i>. (Drag and drop: Click and hold the mouse button
  on the selected racer. Then, holding the mouse button down, drag the mouse pointer
  onto the target item. A small "+" sign appears by the mouse cursor if you
  reach the target item. Then release the mouse button.)
  You may also select a racer and then press the F8 key or issue the <i>Race | Add to race</i>
  command.
<p>
  For each racer inserted into the race, the following window appears allowing
  you to change the racer's display name and starting position:

<p>
  To modify the properties of any item in the race, simply double-click on the
  item in the <i>Race</i> tree.
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> In the subsequent text, if not stated otherwise, all the commands
  are both in the <i>Race</i> menu and the context menu of the <i>Race</i>
  item in the </i>Race</i> tree.
<p>
  The end of the race definition is done by the <i>End of race definition</i>
  command. You get prompted to store the race settings onto your hard drive.
  The race settings (and measured data) are stored into files with the ".rce"
  extension. You may manipulate with these files exactly the same way as with
  the documents created using your favorite word processing software.
