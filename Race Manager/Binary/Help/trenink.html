<h2>Training</h2>
<p>(Command <i>Tools | Training</i>)</p>
<p>
  The training mode allows the racers to measure their training. The racers
  may experiment with their cars for unlimited time.
  Having the track correctly set up, we may run the training measurement by
  the above command. The training may be run either in <i>manual control mode</i>
  or <i>semiautomatic control mode</i>. Before the training is started the following
  dialog window pops up:

  In this window you may define the behavior of the application while measuring
  the training. Then press OK. The following screen appears:

  Each line of the table represents one lane of the track. For each lane,
  total number
  of laps elapsed, the best lap time and last seven lap times are shown. 
  The box in the bottom right corner indicates the status of the power supply.
  Green color is for the track switched on, red is for the track switched off.
</p>
<p>
  If the manual control mode has been selected, each lane keeps these data
  as long as the racer drives their car. The whole line is reset after inactivity
  longer than 1 minute is detected.
  In the semiautomatic control mode, rides and pauses are rotated in a similar
  way like in the race.
