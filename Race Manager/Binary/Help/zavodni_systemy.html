<h2>Race systems</h2>
<p>
  The Race Manager software allows you to store and maintain the database of
  race systems. The race system is a set of settings and options that determine the
  race run. A new race system is created using <i>File | New | Race system</i>, 
  the F5 key, or the <img src="new%20race%20system.gif" width="16" height="16"> icon.
<p>
  The command opens the property sheet window <i>Race system</i> containing several
  pages.
<p>

<p>
  The <i>Overall settings</i> page contains the following items:
<ul>
  <li><i>Race name</i></li>
  <li><i>Group distribution</i> – here you may specify how the racers should be
    distributed among different groups during the transition to other race parts</li>
  <li><i>Lane exchange</i> – here you may specify the order of the lanes as they
    are exchanged among racers during the race rides. For example, the string
    &quot;13578642&quot; means that the first racer starts at lane 1, then shifts
    to lane 3, then 5 etc.</li>
  <li><i>Race parts</i> – check the parts you want in the race.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>Qualifications</i> page contains the selection of the racer qualification
  evaluation method, whether it is the number of laps elapsed or the best lap time
  achieved during the qualification.
</p>

<p>The <i>Advances</i> page allows you to determine how many racers are entitled
  to advance to the subsequent race part</p>
<ul>
  <li>The section <i>From qualification</i> 
    allows you to specify how many racers are supposed to advance directly to
    a specified race part (quarter final, semi final, final) without attending any
    of the preceding race part.</li>
  <li>All other sections in the page allows you to determine how many racers
    of those attending to a given race part are supposed to the subsequent race
    part. You may specify, how many racers are taken from the top of the race part
    result (<i>Total</i> item) and how many racers are taken from each group
    (<i>From each group</i>).
  </li>
</ul>
  <img src="img/dlg_rs_durations.gif">
<p>
  In the <i>Durations</i> page, you may specify, how long should be each
  phase of the race. The captions are self-explanatory.
</p>
  <img src="img/dlg_rs_points.gif">
<p>
  In the <i>Points</i> page, you may specify the point bonuses for the racers
  as later printed in the result sheet.
