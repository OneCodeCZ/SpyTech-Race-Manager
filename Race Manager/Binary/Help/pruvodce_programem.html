<p>The Race Manager software serves the racers the following functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#a1">Training</a></li>
  <li><a href="#a2">Race measurement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On this page you find a brief description of both of them.</p>
<a name="#a1"></a><h3>How to manage a training</h3>
<p><i>Step 1: Software and sensor setup</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
    If you run the software for the first time on your computer, it is
    probable that the initial settings has not yet been performed. In this step
    you put in your track data and set the STM/2008 device so that it correctly
    reads the track outputs. The dialogue window for the setup is in menu
    <i>Tools</i>, item <i>Settings</i>. You may find more information on the
    page <a href="nastaveni.html">Setup</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Step 2: The training mode start</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    You may run the training mode using the command <i>Tools</i> | <i>Training</i>.
    The dialog window which pops up allows you to choose the training type.
    More info on the page <a href="trenink.html">Training</a>.</p>

<a name="#a2"></a><h3>How to manage a race</h3>
<p><i>Step 1: Software and sensor setup</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>See step 1 of the previous paragraph.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Step 2: Database of racers.</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
    Before the race may start, it is necessary to specify which racers are about
    to attend the race. In the race definition phase (step 4), the racers are
    chosen from the database of racers which has to be filled up with relevant
    data before the race defition starts. These data are persistent and are available
    every time you run the software.
    See page <a href="zavodnici.html">Racers</a> for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Step 3: Race systems</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
    The race measurement is driven by rules specified by the race system.
    For instance, the duration of rides, the lane exchange rules, the count of
    the racers to be advanced into subsequent race parts etc. The race systems
    are stored and used in a similar manner as the racers.
    See page <a href="zavodni_systemy.html">Race systems</a> for details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Step 4: Race definition</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
    The race is defined by choosing a race system and racers, both already defined
    earlier. See the page <a href="definice_zavodu.html">Race definition</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Step 5: Race measurement</i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>
    The qualification phase is measured according to different rules than the
    measurement of the other parts of the race. See <a href="mereni_kvalifikace.html">qualification
    measurement</a> and <a href="mereni_ostatnich.html">measurement of the other race parts</a> respectively.
    Various data and score sheets are generated as the race is in progress. These sheets
    may be viewed, printed and exported into HTML.
    See <a href="vysledkove_listiny.html">Score sheets</a>.</p>
