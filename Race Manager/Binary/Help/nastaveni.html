  In this property sheet dialog window you may set up the basic parameters of the track
  and STM/2008 communication.
</p>

<p>
  Put in the owner's name, the track's name and its length in centimeters (so that
  correct average speed may be correctly calculated). Very important is the
  correct assignment of the colors to the lanes.

<p>
  Switch to the STM/2008 page of the property sheet. Here you may set up the parameters
  of the connection to the STM/2008 device which works as the interface between your track
  and the PC. Specify the COM port which the track is connected to (<i>Port selection</i> item)
  and specify whether to invert the sensors or not (<i>Invert sensors</i> item). Dead strip
  tracks usually don't require the sensors to be inverted, tracks with the optical sensors
  usually do.
<p>
  The <i>Sensor - Lane mapping</i> allows you to assign arbitrary lane to any sensor.
  By default, the sensor 1 is mapped to the lane 1, sensor 2 to lane 2 and so on. You may
  use this if the sensors were assigned in a different manner. If you are not sure,
  which sensor is assigned to which lane, use the Automatic mapping feature which is
  described in the dialog window itself.
<p>
  Note for MS Windows NT, 2000 and XP users: After the installation of the program,
  on the first operation which requires a communication between the PC and
  STM/2008 (any race mode or lane mapping is started), a dialog window to set up the
  serial port parameters is shown. Put in the following:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Transfer speed (bits per second): 19200</li>
  <li>Data bits (byte length): 8</li>
  <li>Parity: None</li>
  <li>Stop-bits count: 1</li>
  <li>Data flow control: None</li>
</ul>
