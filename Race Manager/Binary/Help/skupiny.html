  The <i>Racers Available</i> list contains the list of racers which are 
  not assigned to any of the groups. This list is usually empty by the begin
  of editing.
  The <i>Groups</i> list contains the list of all groups defined. The <i>Group members</i>
  contains all the racers being members of the selected group in the <i>Groups</i> list.
</p>
<p>The <i>&lt;-- Remove all</i> button moves all the racers from the selected
  group into the list of unassigned racers. 
  The <i>&lt;-- Remove</i> button performs the same operation but only for
  the selected racer in the <i>Group members</i> list.  
  The <i>Add --&gt;</i> button moves
  the selected racers from the list of unassigned racers into the selected group.
<p>
<p>The <i>Automatic</i> button performs the automatic distribution among the groups
  according to the rules of the active race system. The <i>Print</i> button opens
  the document containing the group distribution and allows you to print out the
  current group distribution.
